        # TODO: Implement me! Read the docstring above carefully for expected features.
        #
        # Hint (#1): There are 2 ways to pass the inputs to the model. Please open the
        # [GPT2LMHeadModel documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2#transformers.GPT2LMHeadModel) 
        # and read the `Parameters` and `Returns` sections while looking at these hints.
        # Either of these approaches is fine since we don't expect the most efficient solution:
        #
        #   1. **If recomputing the past decoder processes at each decoding step:**
        #       Since the tokenizer's output dictionary keys matches these `Parameter` 
        #       i.e. arguments of the model you can directly do:
        #       ```python
        #       >> self.model(**inputs)
        #       ```
        #       Just be careful and think about how you modify the "input_ids" 
        #       and "attention_mask" keys across decoding steps. 
        
        #   2. **If using cached decoder hidden states at each decoding step:**
        #       To speed up the process (although *not required*) you can also get 
        #       the computed key/values hidden-states *so far* with `use_cache=True`
        #       where in the first step you may need to do:
        #       ```python
        #       >> self.model(**inputs, use_cache=True)
        #       ```
        #       This will return an extra dictionary entry called "past_key_values".
        #       In the next steps you would do, assuming your previous output 
        #       dict is called `outputs`:
        #       ```python
        #       >> self.model(**inputs, use_cache=True, past_key_values=outputs["past_key_values"])
        #       ```
        #       Again, be careful as to how you modify the "input_ids" and 
        #       "attention_mask" keys across decoding steps. In particular the 
        #       cached setting expects them to be different from the non-cached 
        #       setting. Read the `Parameters` and `Returns` sections of the 
        #       GPT2LMHeadModel carefully.
        #
        # Hint (#2): You can implement and use the `self.prepare_next_inputs` 
        #   function in `a3_utils.py` inherited by all decoding and sampling classes 
        #   (although you are not required to) to reduce repeated code and make it
        #   more readable. There isn't a unique solution for this so use it as you wish
        #   or create another function in this super class.
